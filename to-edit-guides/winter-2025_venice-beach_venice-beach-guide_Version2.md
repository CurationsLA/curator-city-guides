The CurationsLA Christmas and Holiday Guide to Venice Beach

A surf-town Christmas where canals shimmer with lights and Santa swaps reindeer for skateboards

Venice Beach celebrates the holidays with palm trees draped in lights and a laid-back, bohemian vibe. The famed Venice Canals become a centerpiece of festive magic as residents decorate bridges and kayaks for the annual boat parade (venicebeachhouse.com). Along the beachfront, street performers incorporate holiday themes and shoppers browse local vendors for hand-made gifts (venicebeachhouse.com). With mild winter weather and sunsets over the Pacific, Venice offers a uniquely Southern California take on the Christmas season (venicebeachhouse.com).

## Eat

For breakfast, start your holiday morning at The Butcher’s Daughter, a stylish vegetarian café on Abbot Kinney Boulevard known for fresh juices and avocado toast (venicebeachhouse.com). Nearby Gjusta, a deli-style eatery on Sunset Avenue, serves smoked-fish platters, pastries and other dishes that make for a cozy brunch stop (venicebeachhouse.com). In the evening, enjoy cocktails at The Whaler, a casual bar overlooking the ocean, or head to Gran Blanco for modern drinks and an upscale ambiance (venicebeachhouse.com). Restaurants along Abbot Kinney and surrounding streets often create special holiday menus that blend traditional favorites with coastal cuisine, so keep an eye on local cafés and bistros for limited-time dishes (venicebeachhouse.com).

For more casual holiday cheer, check out Belles Beach House, a retro Tiki-style bar that serves Hawaiian-inspired izakaya dishes and hand-crafted cocktails in a laid-back setting (bellesbeachhouse.com). Another hidden gem is Only The Wild Ones, a hi-fi natural wine bar where analog vinyl and mindful conversation create a welcoming space to slow down and enjoy good music and natural wines (onlythewildones.com).

Venice Winter Fest (Nov 22 2025) transforms Venice Boulevard into a winter wonderland with a retro ski-lodge meets surf-groove theme.

On Dec 6 2025, the Venice Holiday Sign Lighting ceremony bathes the historic “VENICE” sign on Windward Avenue in red and green lights; the community celebration includes live music and family-friendly activities (business.venicechamber.net). The Venice Canals Holiday Boat Parade (mid-December) is a beloved tradition where residents decorate small boats and kayaks with lights and float through the canals, creating a picturesque evening spectacle (venicebeachhouse.com). Nearby Marina del Rey hosts its own 63rd Annual Holiday Boat Parade on Dec 13 2025; themed “A Nightmare Before Christmas,” the evening features a light show at 5:45 p.m., followed by a parade of decorated boats from 6:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. at Burton Chace Park (mdrboatparade.org).
