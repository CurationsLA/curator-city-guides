The CurationsLA Christmas and Holiday Guide to Santa Monica

A seaside winter wonderland where skating rinks, tree-lightings and holiday dining meet Pacific sunsets.

Santa Monica transforms into a coastal holiday destination. Ice at Santa Monica returns from Nov 7 2025 through Jan 19 2026, while the Third Street Promenade dazzles with lights, menorah ceremonies and holiday markets.

## Eat

Hotel Casa del Mar’s Terrazza and Orla by Michael Mina at the Regent offer ocean-view holiday menus for Christmas Eve and Day. For casual mornings, Huckleberry Bakery & Café serves pastries and seasonal coffee.

## Do

Ice at Santa Monica opens Nov 7 and runs through Jan 19; the city tree lighting on Nov 20 kicks off Third Street Promenade festivities. Pacific Park lights a 40-foot tree and hosts Surfing Santa photo days.

## Stay

Choose beachfront hotels like Shutters on the Beach or Santa Monica Proper Hotel for holiday packages and ocean views.

## Shop

Third Street Promenade and Santa Monica Place host holiday markets and pop-ups; the Winterlit Holiday Market features local artisans on weekends.

## Takeaway

From skating by the sea to holiday dinners and pop-up markets, Santa Monica blends coastal calm with festive events.
