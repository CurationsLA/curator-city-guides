The CurationsLA Christmas and Holiday Guide to Griffith Park & Los Feliz

Nature, nostalgia and neighborhood charm in L.A.'s bohemian hillside enclave

Griffith Park and Los Feliz offer a distinctive holiday experience where urban hiking trails meet indie bookstores, vintage theaters and cozy cafés that embody classic Los Angeles character. Griffith Park, one of the largest urban parks in North America, provides 4,310 acres of wilderness in the heart of the city, with trails leading to panoramic viewpoints perfect for crisp winter hikes (laparks.org). The adjacent Los Feliz neighborhood, with its 1920s Spanish Colonial architecture and tree-lined streets, creates a walkable village atmosphere where Vermont Avenue and Hillhurst Avenue host locally owned shops, restaurants and the historic Vista Theatre (losfelizchamber.org). During the holidays, this area embraces a low-key bohemian celebration, favoring neighborhood gatherings over commercial spectacle, making it ideal for visitors seeking authentic Los Angeles experiences (discoverlosangeles.com).
